h2. Overview

EnterpriseEDI is a commercial shipping and logistics software package by
Cargowise. This library is for customers of companies using EnterpriseEDI
to access shipping details via their API.

I am in no way personally affiliated with Cargowise or companies that use
EnterpriseEDI. This library was put together for a project that needed 
access to specific details of upcoming shipments.
