h2. Overview

EnterpriseEDI is a commercial shipping and logistics software package by
Cargowise. This library is for customers of companies using EnterpriseEDI
to access shipping details via their API.

I am in no way personally affiliated with Cargowise or companies that use
EnterpriseEDI. This library was put together for a project that needed 
access to specific details of upcoming shipments.

h2. Installation

  gem install cargowise

h2. Usage

  Cargowise::Order.by_order_number("123456").first
  Cargowise::Order.by_order_number("123456").all
  Cargowise::Shipment.by_shipment_number("123456").first
  Cargowise::Shipment.by_shipment_number("123456").all

h2. Finding API Endpoints

Logistics companies that run EnterpriseEDI often don't realise they have an API
so tracking down information on how to set it up can be tricky.

If they have a website for tracking you can start with that URL and then guess
the rest.

For example, OHLs web tracking site is at:

    https://webtracking.ohl.com/

Their two API endpoints are therefore:

    https://webtracking.ohl.com/WebService/ShipmentService.asmx
    https://webtracking.ohl.com/WebService/OrderService.asmx

IJS global has a webtracking site at:

    http://visibility.ijsglobal.com/

Their two API endpoints are:

    http://visibility.ijsglobal.com/Tracker/WebService/SHipmentService.asmx
    http://visibility.ijsglobal.com/Tracker/WebService/OrderService.asmx
